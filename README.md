# Volatility Forecasting with Deep Learning

This project focuses on deep learning for stoch process modeling and vol forecating. My main goal is just exploring and implementing transformer models to do such tasks.

Currently, a PatchTST model is being used to perform vol forecasting for BTC.

## Features
- **Transformer-based Volatility Forecasting:** PatchTST for time series
- **Custom Deep Learning Algorithms:** Ongoing work towards building models from scratch
- **Comparitive Models: GARCH(1,1), Kalman Filter
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** MSE, MAE, QLIKE, Directional Accuracy 
- **Visualizations:** Prediction plots and metrics for model comparison
